# Spotify clone
Simple Spotify's client application that uses Spotify API for communication. 

## Description
This application is client application with same design as Spotify's front page and an example of using their API.

## About Spotify Web API
It is a REST API that returns JSON metadata about music artists, albums, and tracks, directly from the Spotify. Documentation for using this API can be seen on this [link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/). <br/>
For easier usage of the API I have used an open-source lightweight [wrapper](https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-web-api-js). It provides additional functions for working with users' data, tracks, albums, player functionalities, etc.

## Implementation
Application is made in React using Hooks & Context API.

Material-UI, Flexbox and CSS Grid are used for designing user interface.<br/> 
Application has user authentication implemented with Spotify API.

IDE for development was Visual Studio Code.
